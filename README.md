Hello,

I'm Dimas Nazli Bahaduri (C0nfuseus), I just finished my bachelor's degree on Computer Engineering at Institute Technology of Sepuluh Nopember.

I'm interested in Design and Arts.As right now, I'm trying to love programming. Hopefully this github page could be my journey's witness to love programming. I currently live in South Jakarta. If you would like to discuss with me about anything I would love to hear that. I hope some of you who willing to tell me about programming,cause I know that I sucks at this topics.

You can reach me via:
